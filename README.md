# Programming in R
## Homework Task I -- git and GitHub

This is your first homework task. Since it will not be graded there is no deadline. Nevertheless, we strongly encourage you to try out this task, both to get to know the homework task format and to get to know git. All the following tasks will assume that you know how to use `git` and *GitHub*.

## Information Material

* [Slides]()
* Recommended resources
  * **[Software Carpentry Git Course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)**: A very good and thorough first `git` course that teaches how to use `git` from the command line. It is strongly recommended that you know the command line `git`, since you will understand what is going on under the hood even when using other tools. Expected reading time: 3 hours.
  * **[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)**: A course of `git`, *GitHub*, and *RStudio*. This will teach you how to use all your tools together efficiently. 
* Additional resources
  * **[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)**: Similar to the "*Software Carpentry Git Course*" but with less explanation.
  * **[Git and GitHub](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)** by Hadley Wickham: A quick intro on how to use `git`, *GitHub*, and *RStudio* that is shorter than "*Happy Git with R*" above and may be for you if you are a quick learner.
  * **[GitHub Introduction](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)**: Get to know the *GitHub* web interface
  * **Cheat Sheets** are an excellent way to keep a reference around and to look up commands you may have forgot. The big `git` companies all offer one (and GitHub isn't necessarily the best): [GitHub](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet). Look at all of them and see if you find them useful.
